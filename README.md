💬 Need Help?

If you're not sure whether Ruby is installed, type this in your terminal:

ruby -v

You should see something like:

ruby 3.0.2p107 (2021-07-07 revision 0db68f0233)

If not, you can install Ruby via rbenv or your system’s package manager (like brew install ruby on Mac).

Happy learning! 🇮🇹✨
